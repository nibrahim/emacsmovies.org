If you're a first time visitor to Emacs Movies or a new comer to Emacs in general, the material on the site can get confusing. This page is an attempt to give you a step by step guide to decide which videos you want to watch and in what order. 
</p>

<p>
This page is not automatically updated and so might be a little out of date. The <a href="/blog/archives">archives page</a> is a list of all the posts on the site in reverse chronological order (oldest last). The movies are made from basic to advanced so if you watch them in that order (oldest first), you'll get everything in according to my original plan. The archives page is automatically generated when I post a new video so if you find that this page is and the archive page disagree, the latter is the authoritative source. 
</p>

<p>
The whole series, as I have them planned is divided into four sections. This is a high level list with a list of links to the videos in the order you should watch them if you're an absolute newcomer. Experienced users can skip the ones that they're already familiar with.
</p>
