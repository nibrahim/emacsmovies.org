I've started "Season" 2 of the series with a screencast on [dired](http://www.gnu.org/s/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html). It's Emacs' "file browser" and can be used to manage files. Performing operations on a large number of them at once and also providing such facilities to other modes. 

I apologise for the hiatus but I've been very busy in my real life. I expect more delays till the end of January but I'll do what I can.

Comments welcome.

Keys mentioned
--------------
1. `C-x d` to start dired with a directory. `find-name-dired` and `find-dired` can be used to select different files for the initial dired buffer.
2. `s` to toggle sorting order (by date or normal).
3. `i` to insert a directory into the current dired buffer.
4. `<` and `>` to navigate directories in the buffer. 
5. `C-M-n` and `C-M-p` to navigate dirlines.
6. `RET` to visit the current item in a new buffer. `o` does the same thing but does so after splitting the current window into two so that the dired buffer is still visible.
7. `^` Goes one directory up. It's the opposite of `RET`. If the parent directory has a dired buffer visiting it, it will be reused. Otherwise, a new one will be created.
8. `$` toggles the visibility of the file list under a dirline. `M-$` does so for all the dirlines in the current buffer. 
9. `T` touches the current or all the marked files. `R` is to rename files. `S` to symblink. `Z` is to compress or decompress.
10. `D` marks for deletion and `X` expunges.
11. `m` marks files and `u` unmarks. `U` unmarks all files.
12. `M-s a C-s` searches incrementally through all marked files.
13. `C-t C-t` displays image thumbnails. `C-t i` displays a scaled version of the image in a new window.
14. `% g` marks files based on whether they contain a provided regular expression. Other `%` commands are available under the *Regexp* menu. 
15. `* /` marks all directories and `t` toggles marked/unmarked files. The *Mark* menu has other such commands to make marking easy.
16. `+` creates new directories and `w` copies marked (or current) items into the kill ring.
17. If you're using `gnus`, you can run `turn-on-gnus-dired-mode` and get keybindings like `C-c C-m C-a` to attach marked files into a new email and go to the composer. 
18. `C-x` `C-q` to enter wdired which makes the file names in the buffer editable. You can make changes and then hit `C-c` `C-c` to save them.
