title: "Keyboard macros"

A little late but it's finally up. We're discussing keyboard macros in this episode. 

[Keyboard macros](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Keyboard-Macros.html#Keyboard-Macros) are Emacs' way of recording and playing back a series of keys. It's a useful feature that many people don't sufficiently use. The excellent [Emacs Rocks](http://emacsrocks.com/) series of screencasts has [some episodes](http://emacsrocks.com/e02.html) on clever macro usage to reduce the number of keys needed to perform some kind of task.

Topics covered
--------------

1. `C-x (` and `C-x )` to start and stop recording macros. With prefix arguments `C-u` and `C-u C-u`, you can append to existing macros. 
1. `C-x e` to replay macros. You can do this a number of times in one shot using prefix arguments. Also, the `apply-macro-to-region-lines` function to apply a macro to all lines in a region.
1. The `C-x` `C-k` `C-i` chord to insert the macro counter while recording a macro. Modifying the macro counter using `C-x` `C-k` `C-a` and `C-x` `C-k` `C-c`. 
1. The `C-x` `q` command to stop while playing back a macro so that you can enter some text or make minor variations. 
1. The `C-x` `C-k` `n` to name the last macro and `C-x` `C-k` `b` to bind the last entered macro to a key. Finally, `insert-kbd-macro` to actually insert a macro as elisp into your current buffer so that you can save it for future use. 

The `F3` and `F4` keys offer a convenient combination of the basic macro record and playback functions. 

`F3` stands for `kmacro-start-macro-or-insert-counter`. When it is hit the first time, the effect is the same as `C-x` `(` (i.e. start recording a macro). While this is going on, if it is hit again, it will work like you hit `C-x` `C-k` `C-i` (i.e. insert the macro counter). 
`F4` is bound to `kmacro-end-or-call-macro`. This will, if hit while a macro is being recorded, end the recording process. Here, it is similar to `C-x` `)`. If hit while a macro is not being recorded, it will work like `C-x` `e` and call the last recorded macro. 


Macros are a little expansive so I took some liberties filtering out some of the features that I thought were not that useful. These are

1. [Editing macros](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Edit-Keyboard-Macro.html#Edit-Keyboard-Macro).
1. [Interactively editing macros](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Keyboard-Macro-Step_002dEdit.html#Keyboard-Macro-Step_002dEdit)
1. [The macro ring](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Keyboard-Macro-Ring.html#Keyboard-Macro-Ring) which contains all the macros created so far. 

I might do another screencast describing these but the manual page is explanatory and the things which I have covered will suffice for day to day usage.
