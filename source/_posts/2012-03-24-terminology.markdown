title: "Terminology"

This is a screencast that introduces the basics of the editor and talks about the special meanings of terms like "window", "frame" etc. that are often used in Emacs. 

It's the first one which I've done so feedback is welcome. Please email me at [noufal@emacsmovies.org](mailto:noufal@emacsmovies.org) or tweet to [@emacsmovies](http://twitter.com/emacsmovies) to let me know what you think.

Enjoy!

(P.S.: I will post the link to the relevant chapter in the companion book as soon as I'm done with it. A day or two at the most).

**Update: ** The relevant chapter of the book is at [book/25_ch_terminology.html](http://emacsmovies.org/book/25_ch_terminology.html).
