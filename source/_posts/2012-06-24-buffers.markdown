This episode describes buffers and how to use them. 

I'm sorry about the gap but my real life got a little hectic and I had to take a couple of weeks off.

I've also changed the video bitrate for the mkv file to something much lesser. I can't see a video quality degradation but the file size is much smaller now. Do let me know if you experience any problems.

The H.264 version of the video for iOS devices is at <https://archive.org/download/EmacsMovies/05-episode-buffers.mkv>.

Feedback, as always, is welcome.
