I've picked up something this time which I've always wanted to study properly -- [*Gnus*](http://gnus.org/). The Emacs news and email reader. This is going to be a multipart episode since Gnus is so big. I don't know how many exactly but as of now, I've got a 3 part thing planned. 

Also, the hiatus was unexpected. Things should be smoother now.

Comments welcome.

Summary
-------
1. The `gnus-select-method` variable decides where to pick news from. 
2. `M-x gnus` starts gnus. 
3. `g` refreshes subsribed groups.
4. `F` looks for new groups. 
5. `^` takes you into the server buffer. 
6. `RET` will do different things depending on where you are. On a group, it will show you articles in the group.
7. `t` toggles topics in the Groups buffer. 
8. `L` shows all groups (including ones with no unread articles). 
9. `l` shows only groups with no unread articles.
10. `c` catches up a group marking all articles as read. 
11. `U` is used to subscribe to a group.
12. Information on groups and articles in cached in the `.newsrc.eld` file which you shouldn't delete. 
13. Gnus uses `.gnus` as a startup file.
14. `gnus-secondary-select-methods` is the variable that controls sources other than the primary one mentioned in `gnus-select-method`. Mail sources usually come here. 
15. The `mail-sources` variable specify where the mail backends should pick data up from. 
16. The `nnmail-split-methods` function can be used to split mail depending on criteria like sender etc.
